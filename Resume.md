## PROJECTS ##
**How country's GDP affect the Unemployment rate and what are the other Causes of Unemployment,**
- This project explores the relationship between a country's GDP and its unemployment rate, we focused on 
Okun's Law and its impact on economic growth and unemployment rates. My analysis Confirmed that Okun's 
Law generally holds, with a 1% reduction in unemployment requiring approximately 4% GDP growth for a 
year.
- I also identified exceptions to Okun's Law, such as during the 2008 recession in the United States and the 
United Kingdom. And identified additional factors impacting the unemployment rate, including jobless 
recoveries and personnel inefficiencies.
- To conduct this study, I meticulously collected and analyzed data, ensuring the accuracy of our analysis. 
Additionally, I identified and examined other influential factors that contribute to changes in the unemployment 
rate. By utilizing data visualization techniques, specifically Seaborn & Plotly in Python, I effectively identified 
trends, patterns, and correlations in complex data sets.

**Financial Risk Analysis of Foreign Market Using CAPM and Fama French 3 Factor Model,**
- In this project, we focused on analyzing the risk associated with investing in foreign stock markets. 
Specifically, we explored the limitations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and discussed how the 
FAMA French 3 Factor Model (FF3F) is a better alternative.
- Our analysis revealed that CAPM is generating inaccurate forecasts due to its reliance on a single factor -
market risk. In contrast, the FF3F model incorporates additional factors such as size and value, which provide 
a more accurate forecast. By using FF3F, we were able to make more informed investment decisions resulting in 
a 15% increase in portfolio returns.

**Airline Revenue Forecasting Using the Univariate Time Series,**
- In this project. Using time series models, we were able to predict and forecast the revenue of major US airlines 
operating from major US hubs. We applied five univariate time series models to the data and, with the help of 
statistical tests, determined that the SARIMA model was the most precise at predicting and forecasting the trend 
due to seasonality.
- This project has demonstrated that time series models, specifically SARIMA, can help identify future revenue 
with better accuracy. As a result, this will aid airline industries in making better decisions and ultimately 
improve overall revenue.

**Edge Computing: Computer Vision – Image Classification identifying the type of lung diseases,**
- Developed a computer vision application utilizing edge computing techniques to perform image classification 
for the identification of various types of lung diseases.
- Leveraged Machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, for accurate 
disease detection.
- Implemented the project to run on edge devices such as Jetson Nano, ensuring real-time and efficient processing 
without relying on cloud infrastructure.
